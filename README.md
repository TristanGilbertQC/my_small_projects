## Section 1: Change Return Program

In this section, we introduce a comprehensive change return program designed to streamline transactions and enhance customer satisfaction in retail environments. The program leverages advanced algorithms to calculate the optimal combination of coins and bills for returning change to customers after a purchase. By automating this process, the program minimizes errors and reduces the time required for transactions, improving efficiency at checkout counters. Additionally, we discuss the program's implementation, including its integration with point-of-sale systems and its ability to handle various currencies and denominations. Through this initiative, retailers can enhance the overall shopping experience for their customers while optimizing their operations.
